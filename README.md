# RAG PDF Query Application

This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that allows users to upload PDF documents, process them into a vector store, and ask questions based on their content. It uses LangChain for document processing, HuggingFace embeddings for vector storage (Chroma), and Ollama's Llama3.1 model for generating answers.

## Features
- Upload a PDF document (e.g., research papers, manuals).
- Automatically split the document into chunks and embed them into a vector store.
- Ask questions about the document content and receive context-aware answers.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
